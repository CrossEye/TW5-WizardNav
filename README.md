To-do
-----

  - [ ] Replace the default tag pill with something that highlights the current step

  - [ ] (Probably) Remove the feature that adds the list of tiddlers to the tiddler for
    for the tag tiddler with the Wizard tag.  This was useful to me in the project where
    I developed the plugin, but it's not a great fit.
