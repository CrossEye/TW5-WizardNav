I especially want to call out Anthony Muscio ([[TW_Tones|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/u/TW_Tones]]), who answered many questions on many threads with a helpful attitude and a great deal of information, some of which I'm still trying to process.  While everyone was helpful and encouraging, Tony went way beyond.

And of course, I can't forget to thank [[Jeremy Ruston|https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/u/jeremyruston]] whose little toy wiki has become so powerful and so beloved.
